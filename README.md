# serde-reflect

Have you run `cargo bloat` and been astounded at the percentage of `serde`-generated bytes?

Are you haunted by the idea that LLVM needs to chew through a substantial amount of IR?

Do you wish `Debug` wasn't subject to similar sorts of bloat?

Do you wish you had a runtime representation of the shape of some Rust data?

## using `serde-reflect`

1. Use `#[derive(Reflect)]` on the types you want to handle
2. Construct a database
3. Register the relevant type information with the database
4. Call `db.deserialize` or `db.serialize`
